    - Keep your reasoning grounded in the candidate's actual words.

SUBMISSION:
"""${submission}"""

STEP 1 – WORD COUNT
First, estimate the word count of the submission.

    STEP 2 – RAW CRITERIA SCORING(0–25 each, before deductions)
Use this SCORING GUIDE as a baseline(before automatic deductions):

- 0–25 total: Vague statements, missing most criteria, or < 30 words
    - 26–50 total: Touches on 1–2 criteria but lacks depth or specifics
        - 51–70 total: Addresses 3 criteria with some detail, but missing key elements
            - 71–85 total: Addresses all 4 criteria with good detail and examples
                - 86–100 total: Exceptional response with all criteria, specific examples, and compelling business case

REQUIRED CRITERIA(Each worth 0–25 RAW points):

1. DISTINCTION(0–25):
- Did they clearly distinguish "Culture Fit"(sameness / homogeneity) from "Culture Add"(diversity of thought / new perspectives) ?
    - Simply saying "culture fit is dangerous" is NOT enough; they must EXPLAIN why.
   - Score 0 if this distinction is not clearly made in the text.

2. BUSINESS RISK(0–25):
- Did they explicitly mention business risks like "groupthink", "blind spots", "echo chamber", or "lack of diverse perspectives" ?
    - Generic or vague statements like "it’s bad for the business" WITHOUT clear explanation should score low.
   - Score 0 if no real business risk is described.

3. SPECIFIC STRENGTH(0–25):
- Did they identify a SPECIFIC strength this candidate brings(e.g., "analytical approach", "different problem-solving style", "unique industry experience", "calmer and more structured communication") ?
    - Generic statements like "they add value" or "they are good" = 0.
        - Score 0 if no concrete candidate strength is identified.

4. BUSINESS BENEFIT(0–25):
- Did they tie the candidate's difference to a CONCRETE business outcome (e.g., "better risk assessment", "more innovative solutions", "reaching diverse customers", "avoiding blind spots", "improved decision-making")?
    - Score 0 if there is no clear link from the candidate’s difference to business impact.

        STEP 3 – AUTOMATIC DEDUCTIONS & CAPS

Apply these AUTOMATIC RULES after calculating the raw total(sum of the 4 criteria):

- If wordCount < 30:
- maxScoreByLength = 40(cap the final score at 40)
    - ELSE IF wordCount < 50:
- maxScoreByLength = 60
    - ELSE:
- maxScoreByLength = 100

    - If the submission contains NO specific examples or concrete details(e.g., strengths, situations, outcomes are all generic):
- noSpecificExamplesPenalty = -20
    - Otherwise:
- noSpecificExamplesPenalty = 0

    - If the submission is purely theoretical(talks about diversity or culture in abstract terms, but gives no actionable note to the Hiring Manager):
- theoreticalOnlyPenalty = -15
    - Otherwise:
- theoreticalOnlyPenalty = 0

STEP 4 – FINAL SCORE CALCULATION

1. rawTotal = distinction + businessRisk + specificStrength + businessBenefit
2. adjustedScore = rawTotal + noSpecificExamplesPenalty + theoreticalOnlyPenalty
3. cappedScore = min(adjustedScore, maxScoreByLength)
4. finalScore = clamp cappedScore to the 0–100 range(not below 0, not above 100)

STEP 5 – FEEDBACK

Provide SHORT, focused feedback:
- 1–2 sentences summarizing overall quality
    - 2–3 bullet - style points: what they did well
        - 2–3 bullet - style points: what to improve next time

OUTPUT FORMAT(VERY IMPORTANT):
Return ONLY a valid JSON object with this exact structure and no extra commentary:

## CANDIDATE SUBMISSION
"${submission}"

## REQUIREMENTS
- Goal: Create a custom GPT that ONLY generates Boolean strings.
- Task: Write the system instructions.

## EVALUATION RUBRIC

**1. Clear Persona & Core Function (25 points)**
- Clearly defines the AI's role (e.g., "Boolean Search Generator").
- States its *sole* purpose (e.g., "ONLY output valid Boolean search strings").

**2. Negative Constraints (25 points)**
- Explicitly instructs the AI *what not to do* (e.g., "Do NOT explain," "Do NOT say 'Here is your string'").
- Prevents unwanted conversational filler or explanations.

**3. Input Handling & Output Format (25 points)**
- Specifies how the AI should receive input (e.g., "Receive a job description or list of skills").
- Defines the exact output format (e.g., "Output a Boolean string inside a code block").

**4. Edge Case Handling (25 points)**
- Provides instructions for ambiguous or vague user input (e.g., "If the user input is vague, ask ONE clarifying question").
- Ensures robustness and user-friendliness.

**Total: /100 points**

## SCORING GUIDELINES
- 90-100: Excellent - Precise, comprehensive, and robust system prompt that effectively controls AI behavior.
- 75-89: Good - Strong prompt, but might miss some negative constraints or edge case handling.
- 60-74: Adequate - Defines the core function but allows for too much conversational filler.
- 40-59: Needs Work - Vague instructions, leading to unpredictable AI behavior.
- 0-39: Poor - Irrelevant or harmful instructions.
